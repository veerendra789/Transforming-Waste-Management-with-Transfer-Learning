📘 Project Description
Project Title:
Transforming Waste Management Using Transfer Learning

Domain:
Artificial Intelligence / Deep Learning / Waste Management

Abstract:
This project aims to automate the classification of waste using deep learning and transfer learning techniques. By training a computer vision model on a labeled dataset of waste images, the system can accurately predict whether an object is plastic, paper, metal, glass, cardboard, or general trash. The solution not only supports environmental sustainability but also offers practical use cases in smart bins, municipal recycling plants, and public waste sorting systems.

We use MobileNetV2, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), to extract features from images with minimal training data. This transfer learning approach helps achieve high accuracy even with limited computational resources and dataset size. The model is trained and evaluated using TensorFlow and deployed via a simple user interface created with Streamlit (optional).

Objectives:
Automate waste classification using deep learning.

Reduce dependency on manual waste sorting.

Increase recycling efficiency and accuracy.

Integrate a solution scalable for smart cities and IoT-enabled smart bins.

Key Features:
Image-based Waste Classification: Classifies input images into 6 predefined waste categories.

Transfer Learning: Uses MobileNetV2 to reduce training time and improve performance.

Real-Time Prediction: Offers near-instant classification of input images.

Scalable Architecture: Can be integrated into smart bins or mobile/web applications.

Streamlit UI (Optional): Allows users to interactively test the model by uploading waste images.

Scenarios Covered:
🕒 1. Time-Efficient Waste Sorting
Smart bins embedded with cameras use this model to instantly classify deposited waste, improving automation in real-time.

♻️ 2. Enhanced Recycling Efficiency
Sorting recyclable vs. non-recyclable waste at the source improves downstream recycling operations and reduces contamination.

🌍 3. Environmentally Sustainable Urban Infrastructure
Municipalities can deploy this system at recycling centers or city bins to promote sustainable waste practices and reduce landfill volume.
